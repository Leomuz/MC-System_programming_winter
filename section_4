/*pro Processing 
this is the first step in c performed using using the pro process
 toolbar.all starting with# areused, then converts program to an intermediate
  file. there are also processes like comments removal,macros expansion like definning a value 
area of circle->compilation->int main()

compiling
uses in belt compilation processor software that processes and then translates
 intermediate file to assembly file.
int main-> compiller->push

assembling
s.file converts into a manchine code(binary). here there is the bnary, hexa decimal and
 extentions of .obj in DOS snd .o in Unix
push-> asembler->01001001

 Linking
 here files are included to library files. These are lib files and .obj and the .o for unix

Assembler is a program for converting instructions written in low-level assembly code into relocatable
 machine code and generating along information for the loader.
 It generates instructions by evaluating symbols) in operation field and find the value of 
symbol and literals to produce machine code.START: This instruction starts the execution of
 program from location,MOVER: It moves the content,MOVEM: It moves the content of register 
 into memory operand,LTORG: It assigns address to literals(current LC value).
DS(Data Space): It assigns a data space of 1 to Symbol X.
END: It finishes the program execution

when its off programs are not loaded the main memory is empty but as you switch its off it starts running
the computer transfers the operating system from the hard disk to main memory. thety are execued by double tapping a program
